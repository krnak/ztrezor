### Notation

I use `inline code font` for names of types and variables. I write `type[n]` for an array of type `type` and length `n`. I write only `type[]`, if the length of the array is obvious from the context.

I ilustrate some schemes with pseudocode, where `:=` denotes a definition, `||` denotes concatenation and `[x]G` denotes multiplication of point `G` by scalar `x`.
